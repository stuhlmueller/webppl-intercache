x Improvements to the system (Andreas)
  x Turn into webppl package
  x Don't resample/use factors when you predict (to avoid seemingly low variance due to particle collapse)
  x Use single score/factor instead of many

x MH will add RSA model that illustrates inferring lambda
x MH will plot The Big Sum -- p(d|m) -- as a function of lambda

x Make figures that illustrate performance on slowBinomial (Jason)
  x error as a function of time (different curves for different parameter settings)
  x to explore space of parameters, could do grid search or random sampling

x Andreas: figure out why current system doesn't learn
  x would using SampleGuide instead of SMC fix the problem?
    do this if disableConditioning is on (rename)

x Send a progress report to Noah that describes what we have done
  so far (and what we will do next); maybe send to MH and Andreas first

x make better visualizations for current simple model
  x think about what figure we want
  x send proposal for figure (w/o actually making it) to mh and andreas
  x then gather data (if needed) and make figure

x abstract out prior on functions

x Next meeting: Fri 1pm

x Andreas: factor out mutation to library.js file

x for running time per iteration plot, also make version of plots with window size 10
  (to better understand initial overhead)

x let polynomial degree be an option

x (augment data collection)

x MH: make model slower
x MH: look into (uninformative) priors on regression variance
x also visualize raw data (input-output pairs observed) + guide predictions

x generatePredictions for non-input values as well
x test with degree 3 and 4 polynomial distOnFuncs on (linear) binomial model, visualize

x learn regressionVariance, include when sampling predictions

x then re-examine:
  - (geom_smooth: how to get actual 95% confidence interval, or something like that?)
  x test with binomial variance (or some other non-linear function)
  x verify that, if family of approximating functions is too limited (e.g. f(x)=1, f(x)=c), we don't converge to using the cache
